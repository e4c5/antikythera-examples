# Example generator.yml configuration for Duplication Detector

duplication_detector:
  # SINGLE CLASS ANALYSIS
  # Specify a fully qualified class name to analyze only that class
  # This is much faster than analyzing the entire codebase
  # Example: target_class: "com.csi.bm.approval.service.impl.AdmissionServiceImpl"
  target_class: null  # Set to a class name or leave as null to analyze all
  
  # DETECTION SETTINGS
  # Use a preset for quick configuration
  preset: "moderate"  # Options: strict, moderate, lenient
  
  # Or customize individual settings:
  min_lines: 5         # Minimum lines for duplicate detection
  threshold: 0.75      # Similarity threshold (0.0-1.0), 0.75 = 75%
  include_tests: false # Include test files in analysis
  
  # Exclude patterns (glob format)
  exclude_patterns:
    - "**/test/**"
    - "**/*Test.java"
    - "**/target/**"
    - "**/build/**"
    - "**/.git/**"
  
  # Similarity weights (must sum to 1.0)
  similarity_weights:
    lcs: 0.4           # Longest Common Subsequence weight
    levenshtein: 0.4   # Edit distance weight
    structural: 0.2    # AST structure weight

# PRESET DEFINITIONS (for reference):
# strict:    min_lines=7,  threshold=0.90 (90% similarity)
# moderate:  min_lines=5,  threshold=0.75 (75% similarity) - DEFAULT
# lenient:   min_lines=3,  threshold=0.60 (60% similarity)
